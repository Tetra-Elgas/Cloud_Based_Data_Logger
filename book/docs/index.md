# Cloud-Based Data Logger Tutorial

[Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) is one of the indicators of [indoor air quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality#Carbon_dioxide). Let us take this as an example use case for our **Cloud-Based Data Logger Tutorial**.

<span style="color:Red">**Remark.** The goal of this tutorial is **not** the design of a CO<sub>2</sub>-sensor module.</span>



![IoT_System](http://127.0.0.1:8000/img/IoT_System/IoT_System.PNG)The Cloud-based data logger consists of a microcontroller (MCU) and the [SCD30](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867), a CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and humidity sensor. The MCU is connected by USB-C to a laptop, a router establishes the Cloud connection. The free [AllThingsTalk Maker](https://www.allthingstalk.com/) IoT Platform is used for data collection and visualization.
